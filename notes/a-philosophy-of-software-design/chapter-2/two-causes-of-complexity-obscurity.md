  There are three symptoms of complexity: change amplification, cognitive load, and unknown unknowns. What are the causes? Ousterhout gives two: <b>dependencies</b> and <b>obscurity</b>. This post explains obscurity.

<p>
  <b>Obscurity</b> is when important information isn't obvious.

  Another way to put this is that you don't know <i>what</i> is relevant or <i>how</i> something is relevant. You don't know what you need to solve the problem or you don't know how to solve the problem with what you have.

<p>
  This can show up in a lot of ways; for instance, poor naming conventions, code that's hard to understand, or global variables. It's about not knowing what to pay attention to.

  I think there are probably two baisc forms of obscurity: invisible gaps and invisible side effects. An invisible gap is a peice of information that you need to solve a problem that's invisible. You're missing it. You write some code and it doesn't run, but you don't know why. Something is missing - there's a gap in the logic - but it isn't obvious where. For instance, suppose someone is new to environment variables and tries to connect to a database. The connection method looks for an <code>.env</code> file in the background, but it isn't there and they get an error message they don't understand. It's not working, but it's not obvious why. It's an invisible gap. 
</p>

<p>
  An invisible side effect is an unexpected consequence of your code. You got what you wanted and what you didn't. For instance, suppose you write and call a function that changes the some global variable without knowing that it does and that a different function relies on the global variable being a different value. The first function will work, but the second will break, and you'll have no idea why.

  Obscurity increases unknown uknowns and cognitive load.
