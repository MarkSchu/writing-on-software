  <h2>Reflection - Unknown Unknows as Questions</h2>
</header>

<p>
  What are knowns, unknowns, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns? One helpful way to understand them is as questions.
</p>
<p>
  First, these concepts are about what you know and don't know in the context of solving a problem. You have a problem, like "capture keyboard input," and there are things you need to know in order to solve the problem. You need to know what's relevant or required. In other words, there are questions you need to answer in order to solve the problem. And there are four kinds.
</p>
<p>
  A <b>known</b> is a question you have the answer to. For instance, consider the question, "Where do I write my JavaScript?" in the context of solving the problem "capture keyboard input". One answer is, "In a .js file". Another is, "Within a script tag." You learn this early on when learning JavaScript, so for most JavaScript developers, this is a known. This is a question that you have an answer to. 
</p>
<p>
  An <b>unknown</b> is a question that you don't have the answer to. Now consider the question, "How do I subscribe to keyboard events?" while learning a new frontend framework. Because you're new to the framework, you might not know the answer to the question. Until now, for example, you've used <code>addEventListener</code>, but the new framework doesn't use <code>addEventListener</code>. This is a question you don't know the answer to; it is an unknown.
</p>
<p>
  A <b>known unknown</b> is a question you don't have an answer to, but <i>know that you need one</i>. You know the question is relevant to solving the problem. The question, "How do I subscribe to keyboard events?", for instance, is going to be an known unknown for an experienced UI developer working in a new framework. The developer doesn't know how to subscribe to events in the new framework, but they do know it's a question they have to answer. 
</p>
<p>
  Finally, an <b>unknown unknown</b> is a question you don't have the answer to and <i>don't know you need one</i>. Someone without any experience coding will probably have "How do I subscribe to keyboard events" as an unknown unknown. They don't know anything about JavaScript, or the browser, or user events. So that question isn't even on their radar.
