There are three symptoms of complexity: change amplificaiton, cognitive load, and unknown unknowns. What are the causes? 

Ousterhott gives two: <b>dependencies</b> and <b>obscurity</b>. 

<b>Dependency</b> exists, "when a given peice of code cannot be understood or modified in isolation; the code relates in some way to other code, and the other code must be considered and/or modified if the given code is changed." 

Here's a way to think about this. 

First, Dependenices come in pairs. The system has two parts and one part is dependent on the other. Second, Ousterhott points to two kinds of dpendenies in his definition, ones that have to do with understanding and ones that have to do with modification. 

Dependenccies of understanding exist when in order to understand one part of a system you have to understand another part of the system. Understanding the first part depends on understanding the second part. A common example of this is when you dig down into a module's implementation. You uderstand what a module does by looking at its API. You understand how it does it by looking at its implementation. And within its implementation, you find all kinds of references to otehr modules. In these cases, your understand the module because you understand the other modules that it references. 

For example, suppose you see <code>customer.create(data)</code>. It's pretty clear that this is a module that create's customers. But you might need to understand how it does this, so you dig into the code and see 

<code>

  create(data) {
    api.post('/api/user', data)
  }

</code>

Now you understand the customer module in terms of the api module.

Dependencies of modification exist when changes to one module risk breaking another module. I think you can understand that situation like this. There are two parts of the system and one part consumes the api of the other. The first is the consumer. The second is the provider. The consumer is dependent on the provider in so far as changes or failures in the provider may cause changes or failures in the consumer. The consumer references the provider with a set of expectations (the API of the provider)
