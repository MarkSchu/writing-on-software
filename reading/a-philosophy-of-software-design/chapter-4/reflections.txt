Chapter 4 does two things: provides a vocabulary or map and introduces a main programming principle. The map is a set of concepts for talking about complexity in software. The principle uses that language to suggest how to build software. 

First the vocab. 

module 
  part of a system with an interface and implementation 

interface 
  what you need to know to use the module from a different module 

implementation 
  the code that makes the interface work 

abstraction 
  a simplified view of something, omitting unimportant details 
  an interface is an abstraction of an implementation

There are four important concepts: 

  module 
  interface 
  implementation 
  abstraction 

Here's how I think about them. A module is a part of system with an interface and an implementation. The interface of a module consists how how you can interact with the module. You can think about it as a control board of set of dials, values, switches, and levers. Any other module can turn the dials, flip the switches, and read the values. What exacl
